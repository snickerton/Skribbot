# Skribbot
A skribble io bot, currently just a wordlist scraper

wordlist.py is used to automatically join lobbies and simply scrape the chat for previous words.
If the bot gets kicked, it will recognize that and simply rejoin a random game. It also recognizes words
if it is given the drawer role (choose 3)
